# Week 1 Assignment:
### by John Haidoulis

## Scope of Assignment: Build an inviting home page for a gardening/seed store. 

I want the clients, specifically those interested in gardening, to be able to quickly understand the type of mock seed store this website is showing. 
This is so the user can quicky understand the type of stock sold and where to click. I want the user to select links of interest by looking for images of products and finding the links nearby.

Furthermore, the sections should be clear to the buyer and even provide additional tips to keep the reader engaged on the webpage.

There should be a sales section for current seasons sales which are based on crops that are ready to sow in Autumn.

Lastly there should be clear and accessible search bars, login buttons, and links in the header and footer similar to other webpages.

Note: The images and information are sourced from third-parties and are just used for demonstration purposes as practice making this mock website.

## Sources:
1. I used W3schools ul style guide
2. RHS website, Sutton Seeds, Fothergills websites were used for inspiration.
3. CSS Flexbox Layout Guide Page used.
4. For the section colours, Coolors.co was used with one Pastel Color Palette.


## Reflections:

1. I aschieved all the essential user story and developer requirements for this assignments. I also completed a hover effect (One stretch goal) for the header login and create account buttons to make them more interactive. I did not achieve the remaining stretch goals because some would not have been required for this small home page (back button) or smooth scrolling. I also didnt have enough time to complete the other stretch goals.

2. I found positioning the mock logo and "SourceSeeds" inline difficult (even with flexbox) likely because of different width and height for the logo icon. I wasnt able to solve this.

3. Using flexbox was essential to ordering all the images and text in each section and I enjoyed using it. 

4. I believe I got the 90% sales icon working with position absolute and relative.

5. For the title of lists in the current autumn offers, I would have liked to have no square list box, however I wasnt quite sure how to keep it as a title otherwise.

6. I added a transform effect on the header buttons to show responsivness. I liked all the option available for interactive button.

7. In the flower section, I was originally going to wrap the images with their captions, but it wasn't working nicely so i created two separate sections instead for the flower and one for the herbs which allowed a normal justify content to work.

8. Lastly I couldnt get the text in Autumn gardening tips to equally space in *.infoText* class. Ideally I would have liked to add more spacing between the text in each section to make it more readable.
